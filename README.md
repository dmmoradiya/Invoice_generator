An Invoice Generator project built with React and TailwindCSS. Add items, quantity, prices, tax rates and discounts. Download Generated Invoices as PDFs to your device and print out. Use [html-to-image](https://github.com/bubkoo/html-to-image) to capture the data from modal and convert it from canvas to pdf with [jsPDF](https://github.com/parallax/jsPDF).
